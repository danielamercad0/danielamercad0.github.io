        <p>I love cooking and doing spontaneuous adventures. I also love being active,
            as I've played sports my whole life. My absolute favorite activities are 
            water-related. Recently, I've really been into pickleball as well.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The intentions behind the way apps are designed. The example provided
                by the article of Airbnb including specific destinations instead of a
                generic “search here.” This made me realize that apps that do this feel
                subconsciously more interactive.</li>
            <li>I really liked the gifs that "rolled out" exactly how the author wants
                the reader to follow along. Also just the overall format of the article,
                it was a very smooth read.</li>
