						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Your choice of font can become a barrier between what you're trying to communicate to your audience. For example, if your design is image-driven, you want to use a font that doesn't distract the audience's attention from the images. If your design is illustration heavy, then on the other hand, you want to use a font that compliments the style of your illustration. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed the graphics the author provided after each example/step they described. I'm a visual-learner so that really helped me absorb the information the author was trying to communicate. I also noticed the font the author chose for the article itself; I believe it's Times New Roman. They chose that font for easy readability. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

						</li>
