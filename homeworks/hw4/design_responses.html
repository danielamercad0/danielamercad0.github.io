						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I was not aware that millions of people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment. That's as if it's odd to not have a vision impairment. I had never thought of color accessibility as a way to allow those with visual impairments to interact with digital experience in a way that's suitable for all, but taking them into account more in terms of experimental perception. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I loved how simple but yet very telling the examples included were in terms of comparing what to do vs. what not to do. The changes are very subtle but they really showed what difference it makes (even for a person who does not have visual impairment). </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "In 2017, plaintiffs filed at least 814 federal lawsuits about allegedly inaccessible websites, including a number of class actions." </p>
						</li>
