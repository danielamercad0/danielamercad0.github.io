                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> The level of interaction on an interface has no limits. It could be very minute, to something very bold. Together, they bring the entire experience. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> The interactive 'gifs,' especially the first one and the Never-Stop for Radio Design one. The attention to detail for things one would easily pay no attention to is amazing. That alone makes you gravitate towards that and impresses the user by a great deal, boosting thei satisfaction to use that specific interface. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The Norde one really grasps how the consumer can continue to use that specific interface again and again, just from the 'add to cart' interaction alone. It compels the user to actually got through with the purchase because it was so interactive. It feels like you're customizing the shoe in a way, not like you're sorting through the different images to pick which color of shoe you want. Overall, this increases the chances of making the user a consistent user, not just a one-hit-wonder purchase. </p>
