							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Duration animation is crucial. According to several studies, anything shorter than 100 ms is instantaneous and too fast - therefore the human brain will not recognize it. Whereas anything longer than 1 second, the human brain will register as too slow. It's astonishing to me how the minute difference between ms can be registered to the user as too boring because it portrays a sense of delay. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed the side-by-side comparison of the different sizes of mobile devices. It opened up my eyes to how the size of a mobile device cannot follow the same duration of animation for all other sizes of mobile devices universally. </p>
