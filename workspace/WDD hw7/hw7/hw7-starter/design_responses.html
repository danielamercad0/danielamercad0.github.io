					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I never formed the link between visual design (or design itself) and psychology. Perception is such an elaborate field. I am taking a perception class next semester, so after reading this article, my existing knowledge of perception now has a new avenue for design and its psychological applications. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed the historical introduction of visual perceptions from a psychological perspective. It really adds a lot more credibility and a foundational backbone. There is structure through established principles that can be built upon and take numerous applications. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Having an understanding how your brain works will help you become a wiser designer; master manipulator of Visual Communication." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
